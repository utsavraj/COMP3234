# Problem Set Assignment One -- Answer 4

In Workshop 1, you implemented a simple file transfer program on top of TCP. For this question, you are going to convert your (or the sample) FTserver.py and FTclient.py programs to use UDP for socket communication. In principle, you can apply the same logic flow of the TCP programs to your UDP programs; just replace all socket related functions to use UDP. Although TCP provides a reliable end-to-end channel for file transfer while UDP does not, the chance of having packet losses within a localhost or a small local network is very rare. Therefore, we can ASSUME that UDP provides a reliable channel in our testing environment and DO NOT need to implement any reliable protocol in this exercise. Name the two programs to UDPFTserver.py and UDPFTclient.py.
